<h1>My Projects</h1>
<p>This page lists some of the software projects that I've worked on. My
<a href="https://gitlab.com/liamp">GitLab</a> profile contains the source code for most
of these projects, as well as plenty of odds and ends that I didn't think were 
interesting enough to go here.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Sabre</h2>
    <p>A Sparse Voxel Octree voxel renderer written for my University Final Year 
       project. Written in C++ and using modern OpenGL. The software can import 
       and voxelise GLTF mesh files to a high level of detail. I really enjoy graphics
       programming, so I'm still actively working on this project.

    <h2>Java Game Framework</h2>
    <p>A Swing-based 2D game framework and Entity Component System written in Java 8 by
       myself and three other classmates for the 2019 Software Architecture University
       of Limerick module. Probably the most interesting part is the event pub/sub 
       system, which uses custom Java annotations to decouple communicating modules. I
       wrote the event system and the ECS.</p>

    <h2>Laravel LMS</h2>
    <p>A very complex Learning Management System (LMS) written in PHP7 for a large
       international organisation involved in healthcare. The largest project I've ever
       worked on to date. I wrote various pieces of the system including a real-time
       VueJS/Laravel Echo chat system. I also wrote the entire application test suite,
       comprising hundreds of tests.</p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, since this was a proprietary project, I cannot publish the
        source code.

    <h2>Falling Block Game (please don't sue me!)</h2>
    <p>An Android application I developed with two other classmates for the 2018 Mobile
       Application Development module at the University of Limerick. It's a game where
       you try to fit falling blocks into spaces left by other falling blocks. I wrote 
       the rendering code (which uses OpenGL ES), the Firebase-backed leaderboard and
       authentication systems and parts of the gameplay code.<p>

    <h2>NetCR</h2>
    <p>A reimplementation of the fun puzzle game "Chain Reaction" written in Lua, with
       added networked multiplayer. Uses the Love2D game framework and LuaSockets for
       networking.</p>
