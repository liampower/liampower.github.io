<p>It&rsquo;s been ten years since I wrote my first computer program.</p>
<p>As a kid, I loved to read fantasy novels — I still do! — and my father had a collection of dusty old books with strange pictures on their covers. Naturally, young me assumed these must be magic spellbooks. I remember sneaking into his study and gleefully opening Ivan Bratko&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prolog: Programming for Artificial Intelligence&rdquo; convinced I was about to learn some spells. I remember being utterly disappointed at how totally incomprehensible the book was (I still don&rsquo;t know what I expected). Still, I stuck with it and eventually I DID come to understand some things. I remember anxiously asking my father if I really had &ldquo;got it&rdquo; and him laughing good-naturedly at this.</p>
<p>Some years later, when I was thirteen, I watched &ldquo;Triumph of the Nerds&rdquo; and I knew immediately that I wanted to be a computer programmer. I felt so close to the engineers featured in the series, like I was watching an older version of myself. I asked my father the next day to teach me to program. He agreed, and we started out in SmallBasic (By the way, SB is a fantastic way to teach programming!).</p>
<p>It was agonizingly slow at first. I couldn&rsquo;t do anything, and needed my father to type almost the entire program. But I never gave up. The feeling of being able to describe a tiny reality to the computer and watch it come to life was awesome. I realized that, given enough time and mastery of these arcane code languages, I could make the computer do anything. So I kept chipping away at it. I learned to touch type because it was frustrating to always have to seek out the backspace key to erase some mistake I&rsquo;d made. I copied stuff from StackOverflow and wondered why the C code I copied didn&rsquo;t work in my SmallBasic environment. I made all the mistakes in the book; some evenings I couldn&rsquo;t even get my code to compile, let alone run without crashing. I&rsquo;m eternally grateful for my father&rsquo;s patience during this period; I&rsquo;m sure it was sorely tested.</p>
<p>Little by little, the crashes became less frequent. I began to understand the concepts behind the syntax in SmallBasic, and branched out to Java. I learned OOP to make a crappy GUI system I never did anything with. I spent years loudly complaining about C, then read the Git source code (I don&rsquo;t remember why) and fell in love with the language. It&rsquo;s still my favorite.</p>
<p>Ten years later, I&rsquo;m still in awe. I think code is the closest you can get to sorcery in the real world; to me, being able to build and edit your own reality inside the computer is still, fundamentally, way cool. So thanks a lot Dad, I&rsquo;d never have learned to do what I love if you hadn&rsquo;t casually recommended an obscure 90s documentary about the personal computer revolution, and had the patience to teach me to code.</p>
